						<h2>The First One</h2>
						<hr>
						<p>Dear Reader, today I experienced A Hauntening. After the unfortunate passing of my second traveling guide (he took ill after our visit to the Orbmonger), I inquired at the local jockey station and hired a gator driver of some renown. I sat upon the back of the beast with several hunters, themselves preoccupied with sport hunting.

							Before I tell you of my Hauntening, I must first describe my visit to the Flats. The cracked stone stretches as far as my vision will allow, and after procuring provisions from a travelersâ€™ waystation, I trekked through the jungle to the jockey escarpment. Upon my route I spied a curious pair of creatures, of feline descent. Their eyes pierced my ocular cavity with great interest, and I felt my mind numb shortly. I am certain I then saw then shimmer with a purple light.
							
							The gator ride was enjoyable, for the breeze took away the warm sock of summer that had been lodged in my respiratory tubing, if only for a moment. We arrived at the Gravekeep, a boneyard of great fame and portent. After defeating several animated guardians, the gator overturned a slab of stone to reveal a bottomless pit. The jockey promptly fell in, and a vaporous spirit took hold of his limbs, prancing him about like a marionette. This was most unusual, even for a gator jockey. His mouth agape, glowing with arcane light, he uttered thus: my last wish is... before the gator bit him in two. My companions looked to me (the obviously educated) for advice. I simply retreated with haste, and have made camp on a small hillock. Tomorrow I shall further investigate the bayou.</p>
