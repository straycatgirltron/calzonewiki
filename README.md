# THE STORY CONTINUES
Experts agree that smoking cigarettes is bad for your health. What experts do NOT agree on, however, is the human fetus' RIGHT TO LIFE! At CalzoneWiki, we have THROWN EXPERTS TO THE WIND. We are 100% wholeheartedly PRO-life, PRO-gun and PRO-fessional cartographers of the information age. 
## WINNING THE INFO WAR
Our analysts have determined that in an era of infobesity, information overload and choice paralysis, the complexity of traditional wikis can be overwelming. Rest assured that during your time on CalzoneWiki, you will find NOTHING OF SUBSTANCE! 
## IT'S NOT A BUG, IT'S A FEATURE
New users might have some reservations about pages with no obvious purpose, links that redirect to nothing and pages that install suspicious files onto your hard drive. **THESE ARE INTENTIONAL FEATURES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNIQUE CALZONE A.R.G. EXPERIENCE.** Remember to call a Calzone customer service representative first to report any concerns regarding webcam malfunction or unauthorized credit card transactions.
